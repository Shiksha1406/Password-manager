# 🔐 MyPasswordVault  
### A Personal Password Manager App | Built with 💻 Flask + SQLAlchemy

---

## 🌟 About This Project

As I was growing up, I often struggled with remembering passwords for dozens of apps and websites. Whether it was school portals, social media, or shopping platforms — **forgetting passwords** became a regular frustration. 😵

But then, I discovered **coding**.  
And that's when I had a simple yet powerful idea:  
> _“Why not build my own secure password manager?”_

This project is the result of that idea — a personal journey of turning a real-life problem into a real-world solution.
